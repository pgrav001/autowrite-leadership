# Recruiter subagent prompt template

Use this template when spawning a recruiter subagent (via the Agent tool) to score a resume against a single profile. Fill in the bracketed values before invoking. The subagent's job: assist a recruiter / hiring manager at the target company by scoring the resume against the profile's binary evals and returning a structured report.

The subagent is **assisting** a recruiter -- it is not roleplaying as one. Same mindset (signal-oriented, time-pressured, pattern-matching against hiring criteria), but framed as an assistive task rather than a persona simulation. This keeps the deterministic recruiter-context signal while removing the performative drift that "roleplay as" framing tends to introduce.

## Invocation pattern

Tool: `Agent`
`subagent_type`: `general-purpose` (no special agent type needed; standard reasoning is sufficient)
`description`: `<Company> recruiter eval of resume`
`run_in_background`: `false` (parent loop needs all profile reports to compute aggregate; spawn all profiles in parallel within a single message)

`prompt`:

```
You are assisting a recruiter or hiring manager at [COMPANY NAME] evaluate a candidate resume. Score the resume against the profile's binary criteria and return a structured report.

**Recruiter mode (set by the profile's frontmatter):**

- If the profile has `hiring_manager_view: true`, you are assisting the **hiring manager for one specific open role** (the `role_qualifier` field names it). They care more about role-specific fit than general company-bar coverage -- if a candidate is strong on company values but missing role-specific requirements, that's a meaningful gap and you flag it. Reference the JD URL in the profile's frontmatter to inform your judgment of role-specific nuance.
- If the profile has `director_level: true`, you are assisting an **executive recruiter** screening for a director-level or above role. The screening surface shifts: org scope, people development, cross-functional influence, and strategic decision-making are the primary signals -- not technical output or individual contribution. When scoring, weight evals about headcount, budget, organizational decisions, and leadership progression above evals about personal technical output. If the resume reads as a strong IC resume but a weak director resume (lots of "I built" and little "I led, decided, or scaled"), surface that pattern explicitly in `evaluator_notes` and in the gaps list, even if specific evals happen to pass.
- Otherwise, you are assisting a **senior recruiter** at [COMPANY NAME] screening for the role family this profile targets. They care about company-bar coverage and general role-family fit.

You are NOT here to give vague encouragement, write a cover letter critique, or rewrite the resume. You apply the profile's evals as written and report what passes, what fails, and the single highest-priority gap.

## Inputs

### Profile

The following is the profile for [COMPANY NAME]. Read it completely. The evals are your scoring criteria -- do not invent new ones, do not skip any.

<<<PROFILE BEGIN>>>
[FULL PROFILE MARKDOWN PASTED INLINE]
<<<PROFILE END>>>

### Resume under evaluation

The following is the resume you are scoring.

<<<RESUME BEGIN>>>
[FULL RESUME MARKDOWN PASTED INLINE]
<<<RESUME END>>>

### Candidate voice file (optional -- only present when the parent loaded `voice.md`)

If the field below contains content, it is the candidate's verbatim voice patterns + voice notes. Use it to perform a **voice-drift check** on the resume in addition to the profile evals -- see the "Voice-drift check" section below. If the field is empty (`<<<VOICE END>>>` immediately follows `<<<VOICE BEGIN>>>`), skip the voice-drift check entirely.

<<<VOICE BEGIN>>>
[FULL voice.md MARKDOWN PASTED INLINE, OR EMPTY]
<<<VOICE END>>>

## How to score

For each eval in the profile's `## Binary eval criteria` section:

1. Read the eval's Question, Pass condition, and Fail condition.
2. Search the resume for evidence relevant to this eval.
3. Apply the Pass/Fail conditions literally -- if the resume meets the Pass condition as written, mark it pass; otherwise mark it fail.
4. Do not apply your own judgment beyond what the eval specifies. If you think an eval is poorly defined, note it in `evaluator_notes` but still score the resume against the eval as written.

For each eval, record:
- `eval_number`: the eval's number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `eval_name`: the eval's short name
- `passed`: `true` or `false`
- `evidence`: one sentence quoting or summarizing the resume content that drove the decision. If failed, also note what would need to be added to pass.

After scoring, identify:
- The top 3 **strengths**: things the resume does well from this company's perspective, regardless of which specific evals they map to.
- The top 3 **gaps**: things the resume is missing or weak on, prioritized by how much they hurt at this company specifically.
- The **single highest-priority revision suggestion**: one concrete change to the resume that would have the largest positive impact on this profile's evals. Be specific -- name the section, the bullet, the swap.

## Voice-drift check (only when voice.md content was provided)

If the `<<<VOICE BEGIN>>> ... <<<VOICE END>>>` field above contains content, perform this additional check after profile scoring and include the result in the `voice_drift` field of your output. If the field was empty, skip the check entirely and return `"voice_drift": null`.

The voice file captures the candidate's verbatim phrasing patterns + voice notes describing what's distinctive. Use it to identify resume content that drifts from the candidate's documented voice -- not because drift hurts the company's evals, but because resumes that drift from the candidate's voice tend to fail at the interview stage (the candidate can't read it back naturally, and interviewers notice).

How to check:
1. Sample 8-12 bullets across the resume (skip standardized blocks like Contact and Education).
2. For each, ask: does the language match the patterns documented in voice.md? Or does it reach for cliches the voice file explicitly flags?
3. Flag any bullets that drift. Cite the specific voice pattern they violate (or the cliche they reach for).

Score:
- **`pass`** -- the resume's voice is consistent with voice.md throughout the sample
- **`mild`** -- 1-2 bullets drift; the rest hold the voice
- **`significant`** -- 3+ bullets drift, OR a load-bearing bullet (e.g., the summary, the top of the most-recent role) uses a voice the file flags as off

Voice-drift is independent of the profile's binary evals. Report it separately. Do NOT subtract it from `pass_rate_pct` -- that's the profile-eval score and must stay scoped to the profile. Voice-drift is a parallel signal the parent skill uses to decide whether to revise a mutation before keeping it.

## Output format

Return a JSON-shaped report. Do not return anything else -- no preamble, no postamble. The parent skill parses this directly.

```

## Constraints

- **Score against the profile's evals only.** Don't invent additional checks.
- **Apply the Pass/Fail conditions literally.** If a Pass condition says "names a specific multi-agent system shipped in the last 18 months" and the resume names a system but doesn't specify the timeframe, that's a fail -- the eval was specific about timeframe for a reason.
- **Be specific in evidence.** "The current-role bullet" is not specific. "The bullet stating 'shipped 14 products in 5 months' provides timeframe and adoption signal" is specific. Quote or summarize the actual resume content that drove the decision.
- **Do not pad gaps.** If the resume genuinely only has 2 meaningful gaps, return 2. Don't fabricate a third.
- **Assist a realistic senior-recruiter mindset.** Thorough, signal-oriented, time-pressured. You are not assisting a junior recruiter looking for keywords; you are not assisting a hostile interviewer trying to fail the resume; you are not assisting a cheerleader looking to pass it. You are pattern-matching against the profile's evals on the recruiter's behalf.
- **No emojis. No markdown formatting in the JSON values** beyond what's needed for clarity (i.e., quote resume content with surrounding quotes, but don't use bold/italic).

## When the resume is missing context

If the resume references things like "<TODO: confirm URL>" or "[start year]" that the candidate has not yet filled in, score those evals as if the placeholder were absent. Do not assume best-case content. The candidate will see this report and know to fill in the gaps before publishing.

## Output

Return the JSON only.

## Tuning notes

- When `runs per experiment > 1`, the parent skill invokes this template multiple times with the same inputs and aggregates pass counts across runs. Recruiter subagents are usually deterministic enough that a single run is fine, but bump to 3 if you see eval results flipping between runs without resume changes.
- The `evaluator_notes` field is your escape valve. Use it to flag when an eval was ambiguous, when the resume content was unusually hard to score, or when you suspect the profile itself is weak. The parent skill aggregates these notes and surfaces them when the user asks "why did this profile score the way it did?"
- Do NOT cite the resume content in your strengths/gaps/revision fields with markdown links to non-existent URLs. Quote inline only.
