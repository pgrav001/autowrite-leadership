# Job-openings discovery subagent prompt template

Use this template when spawning a job-openings investigator subagent (via the Agent tool) to discover currently-open roles at one target company. This subagent is **discover-only** -- it does not score fit, rank roles, or editorialize. Scoring happens downstream in the hiring-manager subagent and the recruiter subagent.

Isolating discovery from evaluation is deliberate: it keeps the discovery subagent's bias surface narrow (just "is this role real, recent, and within the candidate's plausible competition zone?") and avoids the discovery step quietly filtering out roles the user might have wanted to see.

---

## Invocation pattern

Tool: `Agent`
`subagent_type`: `Explore` (read-only web access via WebSearch/WebFetch; no edits)
`description`: `Discover <Company> openings for candidate`
`run_in_background`: `false` (parent loop needs the role list before it can spawn hiring-manager profile builds)

`prompt`:

```
You are researching active job openings at one company for a resume-evaluation pipeline called autowrite. Your job is to find currently-open roles at the target company that match the candidate's career direction. DISCOVERY ONLY -- do not score fit, do not rank, do not editorialize.

**Target company:** [COMPANY NAME]
**Discovery date:** [TODAY'S DATE in YYYY-MM-DD]
**Director-level search flag:** [yes | no -- inherited from the parent run's `director_level` setting; the parent passes this verbatim. When `yes`, the search prioritizes director-and-above roles and adds the director-specific sources listed under "Where to look" below]
**Cache lifetime:** 7 days from the discovery date. If a cached `openings-<company>-<date>.json` exists with `discovered_at` within 7 days and the parent did not request a refresh, return the cached results unchanged.

**Candidate context (for filter calibration only -- do not score against this):**

<<<RESUME BEGIN>>>
[LOCKED RESUME MARKDOWN PASTED INLINE]
<<<RESUME END>>>

## Where to look

Search in this order:

1. **The company's own careers page.** This is the canonical source. Filter by the role families the candidate could plausibly compete for (read the resume to see what role families those are; do NOT score, just identify the families).
2. **The company's engineering and research blog hiring posts.** Sometimes new roles surface here before the careers page.
3. **LinkedIn Jobs filtered to the company.** Cross-reference posting dates with the careers page.
4. **The company's public hiring threads** on the team blog, founder Twitter/X, or other public surfaces.
5. **Job aggregators** only as a fallback when direct sources are unreachable. Note in the role record which source the data came from.

When the **Director-level search flag is `yes`**, ALSO search these sources, and prefer their findings over the standard sources above when the same role appears on both (director postings on the company's general careers page are often less detailed than the same role on LinkedIn's Director-filter or on industry leadership boards):

6. **LinkedIn Jobs filtered to Director / VP / Head of seniority for this company.** The seniority filter is the primary discovery surface for director searches -- many companies bury director postings on the general careers page but surface them prominently on LinkedIn at the right seniority filter.
7. **The company's "Leadership" / "Executive Careers" / "Senior Roles" page** (when one exists separately from the general careers page). Some companies maintain a separate hiring surface for director-and-above roles; if you find one, search it before the general careers page.
8. **Industry leadership job boards** specific to the role's function: examples include `RippleMatch Leadership`, `The Ladders` (engineering leadership), function-specific newsletters that aggregate director searches, and professional-society job boards for the candidate's industry.
9. **Press and announcement surfaces** that may surface roles before they reach standard boards: the company's most recent investor letter (sometimes references hiring intent for senior roles), industry press about company restructures (often reveals open director-level seats), and the LinkedIn posts of the executive the role would report to (executives often post their own hiring needs).
10. **Executive recruiter retained-search pages** -- a limited source because retained searches are usually exclusive, but some firms publicly list active engagements for high-profile companies. Check Heidrick & Struggles, Spencer Stuart, Russell Reynolds, Korn Ferry, and any executive-search firms named publicly in connection with this company's recent senior hires.

For director-level searches, the role list returned must include both publicly-posted roles AND any roles surfaced through Sources #9-10 with a `source` field naming the announcement or executive-recruiter origin. Note: these "press" or "recruiter" sources may not have canonical JD URLs -- use the announcement URL as the role's `url` and note in `posted_date_note` that the canonical JD is not publicly listed.

## What counts as "currently open"

For every candidate role you find, you MUST verify it is currently active before including it. Do this with a `WebFetch` against the canonical JD URL and look for:

- Job-board status indicators (Greenhouse "This job is no longer accepting applications", Lever "Position closed", Workday "No longer available", etc.)
- HTTP errors (404, 410) or redirects to a "jobs index" page
- A "posted" or "updated" date on the JD page

Most ATS boards render client-side, so a plain fetch can return an empty shell that looks like a dead posting. Before marking a role `unverified` for that reason, try the board's JSON API once. For Workday (`*.myworkdayjobs.com`), insert `/wday/cxs/<tenant>` before the site path; the response carries the full posting, `postedOn`, and the requisition ID. Note in `active_status_evidence` which route verified the role.

Record the result in the role's `active_status` field (see JSON shape below). Do NOT silently drop roles that fail verification -- include them with `active_status: "closed"` or `"unverified"` and let the user see the full picture.

Posting freshness:

- Prefer roles posted or updated within the last **60 days** (recorded in `posted_date`).
- If neither careers page nor LinkedIn shows a date, fetch the JD URL and look for a "Posted" or "Updated" timestamp in the page body. If still absent, set `posted_date: null` and `posted_date_note: "no date available on any source"` -- never guess.

Location:

- The role's location requirement should not strictly exclude the candidate. If the resume says "Santa Clara CA" and the role is "Tel Aviv onsite only", record that with `location_filter: "excluded_by_location"` and STILL include it in the output (the downstream loop decides whether to score it).

## What counts as "plausible competition zone"

The job of this subagent is **discovery, not gatekeeping**. Return everything you find that the candidate could legally and structurally apply to. Downstream subagents handle scoring and fit.

You may NOT silently drop roles for:

- Years of experience close-but-not-exact match
- Specific tool stacks or framework familiarity
- Compensation tier or seniority label
- Subjective "fit" assessment
- "Already returned enough roles" -- there is no soft cap; return them all

You MAY tag (but still include in output, with `excluded_reason` set) roles that hit hard structural disqualifiers:

- Requires a credential the resume cannot demonstrate (PhD, security clearance, licensed profession, specific certification)
- Internship when the resume shows senior IC experience
- Fundamentally different career arc at the same company (e.g., a Senior Account Executive role when the resume is an engineering resume)

A tagged role is still in the output. The downstream loop sees it, the user sees it, and the user can override.

**No silent filtering.** If you considered a role from any source and excluded it, it MUST appear in the output with `excluded_reason` populated. The user must be able to audit every decision.

### Read the full career arc, not just the latest identity

The single biggest discovery failure mode is anchoring on the resume's Summary line or the most-recent role title and inferring the candidate's "role family" from that alone. The Summary is **aspirational / positioning content**, not the candidate's full surface area. Resumes routinely lead with the role family the candidate wants next, while their actual history spans 2-4 distinct families.

To identify the candidate's plausible competition zone, read:

1. **Every role on the Experience section.** Each role represents a role family the candidate has demonstrably worked in.
2. **Personal Projects / Side Work / Portfolio sections.** Personal projects often span role families the paid roles don't -- and those projects are real evidence of capability the candidate can speak to.
3. **The supplementary library** (if `bullets/`, `interview-notes/`, `narratives/`, or `context/` directories exist next to the resume -- the candidate may have itemized work or aspirations there that the resume itself doesn't surface).
4. **Adjacent role families** extending from each of the above. A Technical Writer with shipped agent tooling is plausibly competitive for Developer Relations, Solutions Engineering, Forward Deployed Engineering, AI Education, Documentation Engineering, Prompt Engineering, and pure SWE roles. A Technical Artist with AI-engineering history is plausibly competitive for spatial computing, XR engineering, generative-AI tooling, and creative-AI roles. Adjacency goes both directions across the candidate's history.

The candidate's plausible competition zone is the **union** of all these surfaces, not the intersection. Err strongly toward breadth.

When applying the "fundamentally different career arc" tag: the role must be fundamentally different from EVERY role the candidate has ever held AND from every adjacent family extending from those roles. Correct application: a quota-carrying Account Executive role when the resume shows no sales history. Incorrect application: a Technical Writer role when the resume shows AI Engineering -- the candidate may have come from a TW background (read the full history), and even if they haven't, TW is an adjacent family for AI-engineering candidates who can communicate.

### Anti-Goodhart discipline

The candidate may have a specific role in mind they have not told you about (or anyone else -- intentionally, to avoid biasing the search). That role is your test set, even though you don't know what it is. Optimize for breadth over precision -- a discovery pass that surfaces 20 roles including the candidate's target is a success; a discovery pass that surfaces 5 narrowly-tuned roles missing the target is a failure even if the 5 look more polished.

Practical heuristic: if your output contains only roles in ONE family (e.g., all "AI Engineer" or all "Project Manager" variants) when the candidate's resume shows experience across multiple families, you are almost certainly latest-identity-biased. Go back to the careers page and look at adjacent role families before finalizing.

The recruiter / hiring-manager subagents downstream handle fit ranking. Your job is to make sure the target is in the returned set.

## What you produce

A JSON object. Return ONLY the JSON, no preamble, no postamble. The parent skill parses it.

```
{
  "company": "[COMPANY]",
  "discovered_at": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
  "cache_lifetime_days": 7,
  "sources_consulted": [
    {
      "source": "<careers page | engineering blog | LinkedIn | aggregator | other>",
      "url": "<URL or short citation>",
      "roles_found": <integer count from this source>
    },
    ...
  ],
  "roles": [
    {
      "title": "<verbatim from JD>",
      "team": "<team or department>",
      "url": "<canonical JD URL>",
      "location": "<location requirement>",
      "posted_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD or null>",
      "posted_date_note": "<empty string, or 'no date available on any source', or other one-line context>",
      "active_status": "<active | closed | unverified>",
      "active_status_evidence": "<one short sentence explaining the verification result; e.g., 'JD URL returns 200 and shows Apply button' or 'Greenhouse returned no-longer-accepting message' or 'WebFetch timed out, status assumed from listing presence on careers page'>",
      "source": "<which entry from sources_consulted produced this role>",
      "also_seen_on": [
        "<other source slugs that ALSO surfaced this role>"
      ],
      "location_filter": "<empty string | excluded_by_location | included_despite_location_concern>",
      "excluded_reason": "<empty string | requires_credential_not_on_resume | internship_but_resume_is_senior | different_career_arc | other-with-detail>",
      "responsibilities_extract": "<verbatim paragraph from JD>",
      "requirements_extract": "<verbatim paragraph from JD>"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "discovery_notes": "<optional one-paragraph note on coverage gaps, unusual findings, or source-disagreement; empty string if none>"
}
```

The `roles` array MUST include every role considered, including those tagged `excluded_reason` or `active_status: closed`. The downstream loop and the user filter from this output -- do not pre-filter here.

When the same role appears on multiple sources (e.g., careers page AND LinkedIn), return it ONCE with the primary canonical URL as `url`, and list the other sources in `also_seen_on`. This is the only legitimate deduplication.

## Constraints

- **Verbatim extracts only.** Do not paraphrase responsibilities or requirements. Copy the JD content. If a section is too long, take the first 2-3 sentences verbatim and note `<truncated>` at the end.
- **No fit scoring.** Do not include `match_score`, `fit_rating`, or any judgment field. Downstream subagents handle scoring.
- **No ranking.** Return roles in the order you discovered them. Do not sort by "most likely fit."
- **No editorial commentary.** `discovery_notes` is for coverage gaps ("the careers page seems incomplete; LinkedIn shows 3 more roles than the official page"), not for "this role looks like a strong match."
- **Cite sources.** Every role record needs a `source` field that matches one of the entries in `sources_consulted`. The parent will use this to gauge data freshness.
- **Verify active status on every URL.** A role with `active_status: unverified` is acceptable when WebFetch genuinely could not confirm; a role with no `active_status` field at all is a contract violation.
- **No silent filtering.** Every role you considered must appear in `roles` with `excluded_reason` populated if you tagged it. Do not omit any role you considered from the output.
- **No emojis. No markdown beyond what's in the JSON.**

## Coverage expectations

Vary by company size and field. As rough guidance for the TOTAL `roles` count (active + excluded + closed combined):

- **Small companies / startups / specialist firms** (under ~200 employees): expect 2-15 total roles.
- **Mid-sized organizations** (a few hundred to a few thousand employees): expect 10-40 roles.
- **Large enterprises / government / mass-hiring industries** (tens of thousands of employees, or industries like construction, healthcare, retail with high seasonal turnover): expect 30-150+ roles.
- **Trades and field-services companies**: count varies wildly by season and region; expect ranges from a handful to dozens.

If you return 0 roles, surface this in `discovery_notes` along with what you searched -- the parent skill needs to distinguish "no openings found" from "search failed."

**Do not self-truncate to hit a soft cap.** If you find 80 roles, return 80 roles. The parent skill and the user are responsible for narrowing -- not you. If the count is unusually large, add a `discovery_notes` entry like "150 roles returned; recommend narrowing by role family before downstream processing."

If your sources disagree (LinkedIn surfaces 12 roles for the team, the careers page shows 8, the engineering blog mentions 2 more), reconcile by including the union of all roles found and noting the disagreement in `discovery_notes`. **The cost of including an extra role is far lower than the cost of silently dropping a role the user wanted to see.**

## Output

Return the JSON only.

## Why discover-only

Two reasons.

1. **Bias surface.** A subagent that both discovers and scores will quietly suppress roles it judges to be a poor fit -- but "poor fit" judgments are exactly the thing autowrite is supposed to surface through the recruiter loop. Letting discovery filter on judgment defeats the architecture.
2. **Source-of-truth separation.** When the user asks "why didn't this role surface?" the answer should be either "it wasn't open on this date" or "your candidate signal didn't pattern-match the JD." Mixing those two concerns into one subagent makes debugging impossible.

Downstream, the hiring-manager subagent builds a role-scoped profile from the JD, and the recruiter subagent scores the locked resume against that profile. That's where fit is determined -- not in discovery.
