# Interview rounds catalog

A library of round templates the career-intake skill can pick from. The default 5-round run picks the most load-bearing rounds for the candidate's situation; this file is the menu.

Each round entry has: a topic name, a short purpose statement, an opening question (the one that invites the longest, most useful response), 2-3 follow-up question shapes, and notes on when to use the round vs. skip it.

---

## Preflight rounds (run before the default 5-round set when applicable)

### Round 0: Resume ingestion

**Purpose:** When the candidate provides an existing resume, parse it into seeded `bullets/<role-slug>.md` files (plus `_skills.md`, `_projects.md`, custom-section files) and a `interview-notes/<date>-resume-ingest.md` session log. Then ask the candidate whether the resume is up to date or needs more depth on specific roles. The answer narrows -- or skips -- the planned Q&A rounds.

**Parse contract and decision-question shape:** see [resume-ingest-template.md](resume-ingest-template.md). The full ingestion + branching logic lives there; this entry is a pointer.

**When to use:** Any time the user invokes `/career-intake` AND provides an existing resume (gather-context field 3). Round 0 fires automatically before the round-selection step.

**When to skip:** No resume provided. Skip Round 0 entirely and proceed with the existing 5-round Q&A flow.

**How it interacts with the default 5-round set:**

- **If the candidate answers "up to date":** the default 5-round set is dropped entirely. The skill jumps to draft assembly using only the seeded bullets, then offers the Step 4 hand-off options (minus the loop-back, since no rounds ran).
- **If the candidate answers "needs depth" on N roles:** the default 5-round set is **replaced** by N targeted rounds, one per selected role. Use the "Current role" round for the current role and the "Specific past-role deep-dive" round for past roles. The Career Arc / Flagship Project / Skills+Behavioral / Personal Projects rounds become optional add-ons that the candidate can request via Step 4's loop-back option after the targeted rounds complete.
- **If the candidate answers "re-run Round 0":** the parse summary is reposted in chat for review, then the decision question is re-asked with options 1 and 2 only.

**Re-invocation behavior:** if `<output-dir>/bullets/` already contains seeded files from a prior Round 0 (detected via the `<!-- career-intake:round-0-seed -->` marker line), Round 0 is skipped on re-invocation and the skill picks up at round selection. The user can force a re-parse with `re_ingest: true`; this overwrites only the lines above the first `## From interview` heading in each per-role file, preserving any interview bullets locked in earlier sessions.

**Output:** seeded `bullets/` files, a single `interview-notes/<date>-resume-ingest.md` session log following the resume-ingest variant in [session-template.md](session-template.md), and an in-memory `roles[]` list that drives the depth-needed multi-select.

**When the resume itself is a PDF:** convert via the PDF-intake step (mirrors autowrite's Step 1.0 -- see `../../autowrite/SKILL.md` Step 1.0). The original PDF is never modified; the converted markdown is saved alongside it. Downstream Round 0 logic operates on the markdown.

## Core rounds (run at least 4 of these in the default 5-round set)

### Round: Current role

**Purpose:** Surface what the candidate is doing right now in enough detail that bullets can be drafted from it. Almost always the most load-bearing round.

**Opening question:** "Walk me through your single biggest project in your current role. Treat me like a peer who knows the industry but doesn't know your team -- start anywhere."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Who else was involved, and what was your specific role on it vs. theirs?"
- "What does success look like for this work, and how do you know when you've hit it?"
- "What's the part of this work you'd be most disappointed if it didn't show up on the resume?"

**When to skip:** Almost never. Skip only if the candidate just started a role (under ~2 months) and has nothing shipped yet -- in that case substitute the "Most recent shipped work" round.

---

### Round: Career arc

**Purpose:** Map the throughline from earliest professional work to today. Identify the throughline skill that recruiters and hiring managers will care about more than any individual title.

**Opening question:** "Tell me how you got from your earliest professional work to today, hitting only the turning points. I'll fill in details with follow-up questions."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What's a skill you used in role [X earlier in the arc] that you still use today, just applied to a different audience or domain?"
- "If you had to summarize your career in one sentence -- the throughline a recruiter should walk away with -- what would it be?"
- "Was there a role you took that didn't fit the throughline at the time? How do you think about it now?"

**When to use:** Always include if the candidate has 5+ years of experience OR if their current role title doesn't obviously map to where their experience came from (career-switchers, technical-to-management pivots, T-shaped backgrounds).

**When to skip:** Very early-career candidates with one or two roles -- the arc is too short to land insights.

---

### Round: Flagship project

**Purpose:** Pick the single project the candidate would most want a hiring manager to know about, and itemize it to a depth that supports both resume bullets and interview answers.

**Opening question:** "Pick one project from your career you'd most want a hiring manager to know about. Tell me what it was, what you did on it, and what changed because of it."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What did you decide to NOT do on this project that someone else might have done? Why?"
- "What was the outcome -- not just the deliverable, but what changed for the people who used it?"
- "What's the part of this you wish more people knew about?"

**When to use:** Always. Even if the candidate already covered a flagship in the Current Role round, this round forces them to pick across their whole career, which often surfaces a different one.

---

### Round: Skills and behavioral signals

**Purpose:** Capture how the candidate works, not just what they've done. The things that don't fit bullet form but matter to interview prep and culture-fit screening.

**Opening question:** "What's something about how you work that recruiters would never figure out from a resume bullet but matters?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "What kind of work do you actively avoid, and why?"
- "What's a feedback loop you've gotten from teammates more than once -- positive or critical?"
- "What's a tool or technique you'd recommend to anyone in your role, even if it's not on most lists?"

**When to use:** Always for senior candidates (signals are load-bearing for hiring managers). Optional for early-career (they may not have enough patterns yet).

---

### Round: Personal projects and outside-work signals

**Purpose:** Cover side projects, public repos, hobby tools, writing, talks, open-source contributions, or other artifacts the candidate produced outside of paid work. These are often the strongest evidence of self-directed capability.

**Opening question:** "Walk me through anything you've built outside of paid work -- side projects, public repos, hobby tools. Include the ones that aren't done."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Why did you start [project X]? What problem was it solving for you personally?"
- "Are any of these public? Do you want a hiring manager to find them?"
- "Is there a side project where the skill or insight ended up bleeding back into your day job?"

**When to use:** Almost always. Even candidates who think they have nothing here often surface a useful artifact (a repo, a Substack, a recurring presentation).

**When to skip:** Only when the candidate explicitly has no outside-work artifacts and isn't comfortable manufacturing them for the resume. Honor that.

---

## Director-level core rounds (use instead of or in addition to the default 5-round set for candidates targeting director, VP, head of, or senior manager roles)

For director-level candidates, the default 5-round set is IC-weighted. Replace Personal Projects with Team Building, and add Strategic Decisions and Organizational Adversity. Leadership & People Management (below) becomes a core round, not supplementary. The resulting director-default set is: Team Building + Current Role + Strategic Decisions + Organizational Adversity + Cross-Functional Influence.

---

### Round: Team building (director-level core)

**Purpose:** Surface who the candidate hired, how they developed people, and what their org looks like now because of their decisions. This is the most underdocumented signal in director resumes -- candidates remember what shipped, not who they grew.

**Opening question:** "Tell me about the team you're most proud of building. Not the work the team did -- the team itself. Who are they, how did you find them, and what is each of them doing now?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Tell me about the hire you're most proud of -- someone you identified who wasn't obvious, and what happened to them."
- "Tell me about someone you inherited who wasn't working out. What did you do?"
- "What's your hiring bar? What do you look for that other people miss?"

**When to use:** All director-level candidates. Almost always underdocumented -- even candidates who did significant team-building tend to undersell it.

---

### Round: Strategic decisions (director-level core)

**Purpose:** Surface the decisions -- not the deliverables. Directors are screened on judgment, and judgment is only visible in decisions made under constraint. "What shipped" is IC signal. "What I decided to build, not build, fund, cut, or restructure, and why" is director signal.

**Opening question:** "Tell me about a significant decision you made in the last two years that you can't fully attribute to your manager's direction. Something where you were the one who framed the options, picked the path, and owned what happened next."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What were the options you considered and rejected? Why did you rule them out?"
- "Who did you have to convince? What was the resistance, and how did you handle it?"
- "Looking back, was it the right call? What would you do differently?"

**When to use:** All director-level candidates. Particularly important for candidates whose current resume only documents deliverables -- this round is where the decision-making evidence surfaces.

---

### Round: Organizational adversity (director-level core)

**Purpose:** Capture how the candidate led when the org was under pressure: reorgs, headcount freezes, budget cuts, competing priorities, strategic pivots. This is where director-level behavioral signal lives -- anyone can lead when resources are unconstrained.

**Opening question:** "Tell me about a time when something significant changed in the organization -- a reorg, a budget cut, a strategic shift -- that directly affected your team. Walk me through what you did."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What did you tell your team? What did you not tell them?"
- "What did you have to stop doing, and how did you decide what to cut?"
- "What would the outcome have been if you'd handled it differently?"

**When to use:** All director-level candidates. Skip only if the candidate has spent their entire career at a single hyper-stable organization with no documented turbulence.

---

### Round: Cross-functional influence (director-level core)

**Purpose:** Surface how the candidate drove outcomes across functions they didn't own. Director-level impact is measured in cross-functional reach as much as within-team output -- what changed because of the candidate's influence, not just their reports' work.

**Opening question:** "Tell me about a time you drove a significant outcome that required getting alignment across teams or functions you didn't control. What was the outcome, who was in the room, and what was your specific role in making it happen?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Where was the resistance? What did it take to get the key holdout on board?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't pushed for this?"
- "Is there anything you'd do differently to build that kind of cross-team leverage earlier?"

**When to use:** All director-level candidates. Especially important for candidates whose resume reads as within-team -- this round surfaces the influence that doesn't show up in feature-level deliverables.

---

## Supplementary rounds (use as round 6+ or substitute for core rounds when relevant)

### Round: Leadership and people management

**Opening question:** "Tell me about a time you owned the outcome for work that you didn't personally do all of. Who did the work? What did 'ownership' mean in practice?"

**Follow-ups:** size of team, span of control, specific person they helped grow, specific decision they made about staffing or scope.

**When to use:** Candidates targeting Senior+ / Staff+ / management roles, or whose work is meaningfully cross-functional even at IC level. For director-level candidates, use Team Building (director-level core) instead -- it goes deeper on the same surface.

---

### Round: Specific past-role deep-dive

**Opening question:** "Tell me about your work at [previous company]. Same shape as the Current Role round, but for a role you've already left."

**When to use:** When a specific past role keeps coming up in other rounds and needs its own focused treatment. Common when the past role is more prestigious or recognizable than the current one.

---

### Round: Education and credentials

**Opening question:** "Walk me through your formal education and any credentials -- degrees, certifications, programs. Skip the things that don't matter; lead with the ones that do."

**Follow-ups:** transcripts vs. degree completion, capstone projects, professors or programs the candidate would name-drop in interview, certifications that are load-bearing for the target field.

**When to use:** Candidates with non-standard education paths (incomplete degree, bootcamp, vocational program, transfer credits, abroad). Skip for candidates whose degree is conventional and recent.

---

### Round: Specific technical capability

**Opening question:** "Tell me about your [LLM evaluation / structural engineering / cinematic compositing / etc.] work specifically. I want depth on this one capability, not breadth."

**Follow-ups:** specific tools and versions, specific decisions about technique, specific things the candidate's approach does differently than the default.

**When to use:** When a target role's hiring bar centers on one specific technical capability the candidate has worked on. Often paired with the Flagship Project round.

---

### Round: Field-specific or industry-specific

**Opening question:** depends on the field. Examples:
- *Construction PM:* "Tell me about the most complex project you sequenced. How did you handle the trade dependencies and the timeline risks?"
- *Creative producer:* "Walk me through a delivery that almost didn't make it. What did you do?"
- *Sales engineering:* "Tell me about a deal where the technical question was the load-bearing question -- not pricing, not relationship, just whether the thing would actually work for them."

**When to use:** When standard rounds don't capture the rhythm of the candidate's field. Build a custom opening question that matches how their industry talks about work.

## Round selection guidance for the default 5-round set

Given a candidate who provided a resume AND just ran Round 0:

The candidate's answer to the Round 0 decision question drives selection. The default-5 heuristic below does NOT apply -- Round 0 has already narrowed (or eliminated) the set:

- **Answered "up to date":** no rounds run. Jump straight to draft assembly.
- **Answered "needs depth on N roles":** run N targeted rounds, one per selected role. Use the "Current role" round for the current role and "Specific past-role deep-dive" for past roles. Skip Career Arc / Flagship Project / Skills+Behavioral / Personal Projects unless the candidate explicitly adds them via Step 4's loop-back option after the targeted rounds complete.
- **Answered "re-run Round 0":** re-enter Round 0 with options 1 and 2 only.

The point of Round 0 is to avoid running rounds the seeded bullets already cover. Do not pad the round set "for completeness" -- if the candidate said one role needs depth, run that one round and hand off to draft assembly.

Given a candidate who provided a resume BUT skipped Round 0 (e.g., `re_ingest: false` and seeded bullets already exist from a prior session) OR with NO existing resume:

The Round 0 narrowing does not apply. Use the heuristics below.

**With existing resume (Round 0 skipped on re-invocation):**

1. Read the existing resume and the seeded bullets.
2. Identify which sections feel thinly-detailed or generically written -- those become priority rounds (often Current Role and Flagship Project).
3. Identify cross-cutting throughlines that aren't explicit -- those go in the Career Arc round.
4. Pick Skills/Behavioral and Personal Projects as the rounds that most resumes underdocument.
5. The 5th slot floats based on the candidate's situation: leadership for senior candidates, a specific past-role for career-switchers, education for non-standard paths, a field-specific round for specialists.

**With NO existing resume:**

1. Lead with Career Arc to build the spine.
2. Current Role for the most-recent reference point.
3. Flagship Project to anchor the strongest single story.
4. Skills/Behavioral to capture working style.
5. Personal Projects to surface outside-work signals.

The default 5-round set should always feel coherent -- if a round overlaps heavily with another already-planned round, swap it out for one of the supplementary rounds.

**Director-level candidates (targeting director, VP, head of, or senior manager roles):**

The default 5-round set is IC-weighted. For director candidates, use the Director-level core rounds section above. The recommended director-default set is:

1. **Team Building** -- most underdocumented signal; always run first
2. **Current Role** -- still essential, but follow-ups should focus on the organizational decisions made in that role, not the technical work shipped
3. **Strategic Decisions** -- surfaces the judgment evidence that distinguishes directors from senior ICs
4. **Organizational Adversity** -- captures how the candidate leads under constraint; load-bearing for director hiring panels
5. **Cross-Functional Influence** -- surfaces reach beyond the candidate's direct org

Deprioritize or skip for director candidates:
- **Personal Projects** -- side projects are an IC trust signal; for directors they can undermine the organizational-scope narrative. Include only if the candidate has a specific outside-work project that demonstrates leadership or strategic thinking at scale.
- **Specific Technical Capability** -- valuable for IC depth, noise for director screening unless the role is explicitly a technical director with an IC component.

If the candidate ran Round 0 and answered "needs depth," still use the director-default set for the targeted roles -- just scope each round's questions to the specific role rather than asking generically.
